  <h1>The London Bridge</h1>
  <p>London Bridge, as we know it today, was opened to traffic by The Late Queen Elizabeth II on 16 March 1973. Now made of concrete and steel, it replaced a 19th century stone arched bridge designed by Scottish civil engineer John Rennie, which in turn succeeded a 600-year-old stone-built structure.</p>
